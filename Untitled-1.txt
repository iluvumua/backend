Workflow for the Application:
When a user adds an equipment from the equipment page then that equipment will be an outdoor equipment 
but when a user adds an equipment from the building page then that equipment will be an indoor equipment
so if an outdoor equipment is added then its state will be "en cours" until another user comes in and adds a meter for that equipment
once that happens and the form page for the meter is filled out completely finishing all 3 steps then the equipment and the meter will become "en service"
but if the steps aren't completed then the equipment will remain "en cours" and the meter will also be "en cours" until the steps are completed
else if an indoor equipment is added then its state will be "en service" directly without needing a meter to be added
because when a building is added the building must get a meter associated with it before the equipment can be added to that building
also the steps for adding a meter for a building are not the same as adding a meter for an outdoor equipment
also when finishing all the steps for a building meter then the meter will automatically get associated with that building and become "en service",and a building can have only 1 meter and multiple equipment and 
an outdoor equipment can have a meter and can share a meter with a max of 1 outdoor equipment
also a meter is created from step 1 for equipment and building alike, an it will get updated for each step like the NÂ°Compteur at first it'll be like "0000000" then in step 2 it will take the input data of the user 
that they put in step 2.
